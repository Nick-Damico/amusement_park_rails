# Rails Amusement Park
This is my personal take on the Original Lab by Flatiron called: Flatiron Amusement Park.

I'm building a more feature rich application using the original App domain as inspiration.

## Objectives

Get comfortable with using form helpers, having models interact with each other, and build out a
user authenticate and authorize system using 'sessions' and 'bcrypt'.

You're going to be building an amusement park. There will be users, attractions, and users can take rides on attractions.

## Instructions
`bundle install`
`rails db:migrate`
